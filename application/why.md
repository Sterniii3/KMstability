For adequately reporting time-to-event analysis, the following is recommended:
<ol>
  	<li>Including the opening date of accrual, closing date of accrual, and cutoff date for analysis (Shuster, 1991). </li>
	<li>Graphical presentation by Kaplan-Meier plots with detailed life tables (Shuster, 1991): see Figure 1.</li>
	<li>Calculation of the stability intervals (and derived metrics) as proposed by Betensky (2015): see Figures 2, 4 and Table 1.</li>
	<li>If median follow-up is required: calculate the median of C|C < X (Shuster, 1991; Betensky, 2015): see Table 2, middle column.</li>

</ol>
