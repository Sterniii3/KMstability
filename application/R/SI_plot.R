#' @details
#' The implementation of the method is done as follows. For each individual i
#' the time of entry into the study t^{start}_{i}, the final recorded date
#' t^{final}_{i} and a status indicator s_i (taking the value 1 if
#' t^{final}_{i} is the date of the event and 0 if t^{final}_{i} is
#' the date of censoring) is observed. Then, letting y_i = t_i^{final} -
#' t_i^{start}, the stability interval can be all calculated using the
#' standard Kaplan-Meier estimator, with the following adjustments.
#' Define the maximum observation time by
#' t^{max} = max_{i}(t^{final}_i - t^{start}_{i}). Then, the upper limit
#' of the stability interval can be calculated by setting y_i = t^{max}
#'   for all i with s_i =0. Therefore, all censored patients remain under
#' risk until the maximum observation time. Let t^{final}_{i^*} (with
#' s_{i^*}=1) be the event time immediately following the time of
#' censoring of observation i (i.e. t^{final}_{i} with s_i=0). Then,
#' the lower limit of the stability interval can be calculated by setting
#' y_i  = t^{final}_{i^*} - t^{start}_{i} for all i with s_i=0 and
#' then setting s_i=1 for all i. If the last observation is a censoring
#' event, i.e. there is an observation j for which there is no
#' t^{final}_{j^*} > t^{final}_{j} (with s_{j^*}=1 and s_j=0), s_j is
#' set to 1. By this definition, the lower limit can be understood as
#' "realistic" worst case scenario, in the sense, that "unrealistic" early
#' events do not occur. However, alternatives to this definition are
#' possible and the context should determine what is used.
