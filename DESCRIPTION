Description: The KMstability package enables the investigation of the stability of the Kaplan-Meier estimate by the methods proposed by Betensky (2015) in a straight forward and easy way. It includes the generation of
  detailed graphical presentations of the entire distribution via adequate Kaplan-Meier plots including confidence intervals and detailed life tables (function Figure1), 
	detailed graphical presentations of the alternative measure proposed by Betensky (function Figure2), as well as derived metrics (functions Table1, Figure4)
	detailed graphical presentations of common measures of follow-up (i.e. time to censoring, observation time and observation time for those event-free) (function Figure3) and derived metrics (function Table2).
